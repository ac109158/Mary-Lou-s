<!--  This website was written by Andrew Cook for completion of final project in VT-3000 at Dixie State University.  The client for this website was Mary Lou Timpson who wanted to have a web presence for her collection of work as a hobbyist custom cake designer.
I would like to thank the following for blessing me with their code:

	Twitter Bootstrap - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html
	I chose to incorporate their code for its ability to give this website compatiblity across different platforms and devices. This was just above my paygrade at this point.
	Thanks to Luke Hansen for showing me this site in the first place. -->
